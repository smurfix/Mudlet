This subdiretory contains (the beginning of) an end-to-end test for Mudlet.

Principle of operation:

* create a defined Debian chroot environment
* build Mudlet
* start a headless X server
* start a Telnet server with some sort of test MUD in it
* start a MudPyC server
* start Mudlet, connect to the MUD server
* auto-connect to the test MUD
* cause Mudlet to connect to MudPyC (some trigger)
* cause Mudlet to do things and check that it did them

All of this is written in async Python.

MudPyC connects to Mudlet using a bidirectional channel which can
send and execute Lua scripts, call functions and return results, etc.

Also, Lua can tell the Python side when something happened, e.g. a button
click or an incoming text / GMCP message.

The server interprets a file with a series of commands that cause it to do
interesting things.
